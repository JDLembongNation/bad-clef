            <p>The temperamental, yet powerful, construct of human civilization has solidified itself as the chief leader of the animal kingdom. From this stage onwards, there are no other competitors in technological development other than the creators themselves. Endeavoring to make the littlest things as efficient as possible, contributing to the grander scale of augmentation. But with nothing but ourselves to build our ideas into breathing structures, something can be said about the lack of 'Survival of the Fittest' within our society nowadays. In fact, the notion of 'the better one wins' exists in a more artificial and intangible state. The human desire to be better than the rest is no stranger to a thinking approach from any era. However, when asked to explain what separates the king of the ladder to the proletariat, our post-modern thinking has us suggesting the one with more money is the winner in this game of life. And for the most part, that is true. No matter which country you visit, the common goal for each government is to boost the economic wealth of said country. With our greatest fear lurking from the alternative reality where we lack power and wealth to do anything, we develop a mindset to keep society in check by preventing any social balances taking place. 
                </p>
            <p>Capitalism is a concept which takes the idea of 'survival of the fittest' into literal terms. Each company fights to maintain relevancy in the market, making claims to customers about how relevant their 'individuality' hits the 'unique' keyword, hoping to gain loyal customers as a result. But with each company hailing innovation, what upsets these perfect competitors into monopolistic competitors? 
                </p>
            <p>The key term here is media. For the lack of a personal voice in this blog post, let me say this. I believe that human attempted suppression of jealousy leads to false and unnecessary media. People have occasionally asked me, "Do you still follow the news?".  And which to that I say no. Not once this year have I even considered anything in the news relevant or at least objective. I have also learned to stop judging everything I see and hear like a dart to a dartboard, linear and one directional. Countless times have I stuck favorably to one side, only to bequeath the argument once I realized how clueless I was. It seems to every thought there is always a heap of secondary evidence to rebut the former or the latter. 
                </p>
            <p>The Palestine Israeli conflict is a quintessential example of factual ambiguity. While there are various arguments to support either side of the dispute, the integrity of the evidential support remains questionable. With each side rupturing into a mood of political unrest, the situation escalates to a much greater extent. While society fails in its adaptation to become frugal in thought, the media remains a catalyst to this already great political wildfire. To picture this from an individualistic, yet objective, standpoint, imagine you are browsing FaceBook. During this timespan, imagine seeing various posts about the help Palestine / Israel needs because of Palestine / Israel. Furthermore, each comment on each post exemplifies why Palestine / Israel needs our help where Palestine / Israel is the devil in this conflict. Who is right and who is wrong? We can look into the history of the conflict and </p>
